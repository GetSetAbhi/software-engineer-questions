# Software Engineer

Hello, and welcome from the Syniti Engineering Team!

Thank you for your interest in joining Syniti, we're working on some
interesting and challenging problems and are looking for engineers with a
growth mindset to join our team. Our interview process helps us learn about
you as a person and at a technical level. But it's just as important that you
learn about us, our work, and our expectations so you know what you're
getting into. We foster a work environment where we are all comfortable and
love coming to work each day. We don't hire lightly and expect everyone to
contribute on day one.

Let's get started!

Please clone or download this repo and use it for the exercises described below.
Once completed you may either send us the URL to your git repo or a zip of
the folder.

We have four questions that we like to ask to get a sense of who you are, 
followed by a coding question we use to understand your technical strengths. 
You can write your responses to the first four questions directly in the README 
or as a separate file.

In answering the code question, please submit code as if you intended to
ship it to production. The details matter. Tests are expected, as is
well-written, simple, idiomatic code. While there are many libraries you
could use, we're expecting to mostly see code that you write yourself. Please
only use critical libraries for common functionality, such as parsing JSON or
writing tests.

We'd recommend you use whatever language you feel strongest in. It doesn't have
to be one we use (mostly Go and JavaScript) — we believe good engineers can be 
productive in any language.

Here are the questions, good luck!

1. What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something
   you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d
   love to know why you’re proud of it.
   
   **Answer 1**
   
   My proudest achievement is to be able to think of an app, develop it and publish it on playstore.
   It was back in June of 2016 when internet memes were a new concept. I was wasting a lot of my time looking for memes and
   express myself humourously while conversing with my friends over internet. At that point of time, I thought of an app
   which will contain hundreds of meme template and then the user will be able to write a text over it.
   I developed that app and called it MemeCanvas. 
   In Feb of 2017 I published that app on playstore and even created a promotional [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrLTyvsW5H4) for it.
   
   Another thing that I consider a professional achievement is when I was trusted by the client for which I was working as a developer 
   to develop some functionality. It was in 2018 when I was working as a junior Software Developer and the Client was a leading bathroom accessory maker. 
   They had an e-commerce store and I was part of the team that handled the development of the e-commerce store. At that time, I was trusted to develop a functionality
   which enabled the e-commerce store to periodically update the information of products or update the product catalog with new products. I successfully developed that functionality
   and was applauded for my effort. That was the first time that I was able to singlehandedly develop a complete functionality as a professional software engineer.
   
2. What's a personal project you're currently working on? This could be a
   coding side project, hobby, or otherwise real world project you're working
   on.
   
   **Answer 2**
   
   Recently, I have started looking into cryptocurrency investment. It was something that I had been looking to do ever since
   I started working as a software engineer. I couldn't start investing early as I was learning to manage my finances but 
   now I've picked up on it. I am looking into the trends of Dogecoin due to the fact that Elon Musk has a personal interest in it.
   I am new in crypto trading but I am learning more about it every day. It's a new hobby i'm pursuing.

3. Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked
   it, and why we should read it.
   
   **Answer 3**
   
   Technically, I've been looking to upskill a bit. I am a backend developer and I've mostly worked with the spring framework and microservices. 
   I've been looking to upskill and become a full stack developer so started learning Angular framework.
   I've only been reading angular related blogs to understand more about angular related things while developing small things to learn Angular.
   There's nothing specific that I can recommend. I do recommend reading technical blogs for any technical thing that one is trying to learn and that is because
   these technical blogs help us to understand better and tell us 'why is something, the way it is ?'. This is a question that comes up most of the time when we are learning 
   something new.
   
   I am also pursuing crypto currency investment as a hobby and for the I came across an [article](https://www.dummies.com/personal-finance/investing/3-short-term-cryptocurrency-investing-time-frames/) 
   to help me understand long-term and short term crypto trading.
   You should read it if you are new to crypto investment and are looking to identify a strategy that suits you while investing in crypto currencies.

4. Tell us about one of your favorite products (physical or software) and one
   specific aspect that makes it truly great.

5. In this repo is a `data.json` file. It contains an imaginary example set
   of data a customer might need to migrate from one system to another. It's a
   JSON encoded array of objects. The customer understands some of the data
   might be bad and wants to know which records are invalid so they can ensure
   the new system will only have valid data. Write a program that will read
   in the data and mark any records:

   1. That are a duplicate of another record
   2. `name` field is null, missing, or blank
   3. `address` field is null, missing, or blank
   4. `zip` is null, missing, or an invalid U.S. zipcode

   Each record has an ID but that should only be used to identify a record,
   not for validity or duplication testing (eg, two records may be identical
   but have different IDs).

The output of the program should list the IDs of each invalid or duplicate
record, one per line. In the case of duplicates, mark both.

Example:

```
123ba
439a2
99abc
bac34
```

If you have any questions about the coding questions, please let us know.
